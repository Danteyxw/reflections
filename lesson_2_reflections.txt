// What happens when you initiate a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initiating a repository creates the necessary files needed to track and maintain the current folder as a "repository". Makes it usable with git, basically.

// How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is an area for the storage of the next commits. It allows the user to specify the files he/she wants to commit.

// How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You can use it to check what changes are made.

// What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

It would help in creating prototypes of intended changes to the code. This allows you to experiment on the new changes and also fix any bugs in the master branch at the same time.
