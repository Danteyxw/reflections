// What happens when you initiate a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initiating a repository creates the necessary files needed to track and maintain the current folder as a "repository". Makes it usable with git, basically.

// How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is an area for the storage of the next commits. It allows the user to specify the files he/she wants to commit.
